  <h1 style="text-align: left;">PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY</h1>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Platform technology is a foundational system or innovation that serves as a base 
          for developing many other products, services, or applications.
           Instead of being designed for just one specific use, it provides a reusable 
           framework that can be adapted to different purposes. Because of this, platform technologies are versatile, 
           scalable, and enabling—allowing developers, businesses, and researchers to build new solutions without having to start from scratch.</p>

           <p style="text-align: justify;">Examples of platform technologies can be seen across industries. 
  In information technology, operating systems like Windows or iOS act as platforms where apps are built and run. 
  In medicine, mRNA technology is a platform used not only for COVID-19 vaccines but also for potential treatments of other diseases. Similarly, 
  e-commerce platforms such as Amazon or Shopee provide the infrastructure for businesses to sell online. 
  This ability to support multiple applications is what makes platform technologies so powerful and transformative.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The importance of platform technologies can be seen in how they transform entire industries. 
  For example, social media platforms like Facebook or TikTok are not only websites but ecosystems that allow developers, 
  advertisers, and users to interact in countless ways. Similarly, biotechnology platforms such as CRISPR gene-editing open doors for medical treatments, 
  agriculture, and scientific research all at once. In the business world, e-commerce platforms like Shopify empower even small sellers to reach global customers with minimal effort. 
  In every field, platform technologies act as launchpads—fueling growth, collaboration, and innovation on a wide scale.</p>
